(A) Windows
=======
1. Edit C:\data\QDev\UniSim3\ship\cmd\win\build.bat.
- Update SUB version number.
- Note that the bin target folder will be erased before building.
- Note that the batch file will switch UniSim3.pro to release mode before building and then restore it to debug mode at the end.
- Note that C:\data\QDev\UniSim3\input will be copied to C:\data\QDev\UniSim3\src\resources\data\input. Subsequently, the resource file in C:\data\QDev\UniSim3\src\resources\application.qrc will be updated accordingly.

2. Check that the input folder contains the correct files in
- demo
- papers
- scripts

3. Check that UniSim3.pro contains the intended plug-ins.

4. In the student source remove day_scale and weather files.

5. If the Qt installation has been updated, check that QTENV is set correctly in build.bat and QT_ROOT, in fill-folders.bat.

6. In fill-folders.bat UNISIM_SHIP must be the correct folder.

7. If unisim(d).exe is running, access will be denied to clear the UniSim3/bin folder: Close unisim(d).exe before building.

8.Execute batch file, *** not as administrator***; this produces errors (?!)

9. Copy installer to sites\ecolmod2\static\download. 

10. Update sites\ecolmod2\content\download.md.

11. Open PowerShell in sites\ecolmod2 and run hugo.

12. Upload ecolmod2\public using FileZilla.

13. In Bash: cd /c/users/au152367/Documents/QDev/UniSim3

> git commit -F "../commit-msg.txt"
> git tag 2.3.n
> git push origin master --tags
- Note this pushes both source code changes and tags

14. Do not erase the src/resources folder. This is part of the commit and is used by the subsequent build on Mac OS (and Linux).

(B) Mac OS X
============

1. In Finder go to nielsholst/dev and delete UniSim3 folder.

2. In Chrome go to Github and copy clone path. (cmd+C)
 
3. In Terminal:

- type >git clone <paste clone path> (cmd+V)

4. Edit ~/dev/UniSim3/ship/cmd/osx/build.sh.
- Update SUB version number.
- Launch build.sh from Terminal >./build.sh

5. Open InstallBuilder and build the installer.

6. Optionally, test debug build in QtCreator:
- run clean.sh
- open UniSim3.pro in QtCreator and build.

7. In Finder, right-click and compress the installer (which is a folder) into a zip file.

8. Upload installer from ~/qdev/UniSim3/ship to ecolmod.org/download (~18 Mb) via FileZilla. The installer is a zip file.

9. Update ecolmod.org/download.html.
